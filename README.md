# CARL Air Brake Power Supply Hardware

This repository contains the electronic hardware design for the power supply
module of the [CARL Air Brake][cab-repo] computer. The CARL Air Brake computer
automatically controls a rocket air brake in flight, so that the vehicle attains
an apogee at the desired altitude. The power supply module distributes
electrical power to all systems in the computer.
