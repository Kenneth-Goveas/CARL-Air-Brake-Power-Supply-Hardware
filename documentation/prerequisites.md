# Prerequisites

The electronic design in this repository was created with [KiCad 7.0][kicad],
which must be installed on your system in order to view and edit the design.
Installation instructions can be found on the [Download][kicad-dl] page.

Additionally, the [Fira Sans Condensed][fira] font was used in the KiCad
schematic and symbol editors instead of the default font. This is because the
default font occupies more space, making it difficult to fit the schematic on
the page. Once installed, this font can be selected in KiCad by clicking on
*Preferences > Preferences > Schematic Editor > Display Options* and choosing
from the *Default font* drop down menu.
